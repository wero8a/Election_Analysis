# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
 In this project we help Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee, in an election audit of tabulated results for the US congressional prescinct in Colorado. If the audit is successful, this program may be used nationally and locally for other elections.
  
  1. Calculate total number votes cast.
  2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
  3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
  4. Calculate the percentage of votes each cadidate received.
  5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
  6. Demonstrate where votes were casted by county and the percentage of each.
